Here are the final grades for Drawing 101: [105, 129, 87, 86, 111, 111, 89, 81, 108, 92, 110, 100, 75, 105, 103, 109, 76, 119, 99, 91, 103, 129, 106, 101, 84, 111, 74, 87, 86, 103, 103, 106, 86, 111, 75, 87, 102, 121, 111, 88, 89, 101, 106, 95, 103, 107, 101, 81, 109, 104]

Descriptive statistics include measures of central tendancy:
   mean=99.12
   median=102.50
   mode=111.00

Descriptive statistics include measures of spread:
   var=179.25
   stddev=13.39


=============================================================

Here's a correlation between years of experience and art forms mastered:

x (years experience):[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

y (art media mastered):[2, 5, 8, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 31, 32]

Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:

   slope = 2.7762237762237763
   intercept = 3.121212121212121

Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.

   At future x = 13,
   we predict the value of y will be 39.
It takes time, but the more you pracitce the better you will get!
